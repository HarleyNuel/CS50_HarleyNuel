Einstein.py

This program is used to calculate the energy given out by a body 
using the famous Einstein formula E = mc^2

HOW THE CODE WORKS  
  The user is requested for input and the input is converted to an integer
  
  The input is passed through the calculate_energy function to calculate the energy
  where the mass, M is the input in kilograms,
        C is the speed of light
        E is the resulting energy

The results is printed out
